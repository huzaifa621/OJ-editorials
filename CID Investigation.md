**Problem Analysis:**

In this problem, we are given a digit sequence representing the keys pressed on an old phone keypad. Each digit from 2 to 9 corresponds to a set of letters (similar to the modern phone keypad). The task is to generate all possible combinations of letters that can be formed using the given digit sequence.

**Approach:**

The problem involves generating all possible strings by considering all combinations of letters corresponding to the given digits. We can solve this problem using recursion. For each digit, we consider all the letters corresponding to that digit and recursively generate the combinations for the remaining digits. We concatenate each letter with the combinations obtained from the remaining digits to form the final strings.

**Pseudocode:**

```plaintext
Input: string S

Function generate_strings(S, current, index, result):
    if index is equal to the length of S:
        add current to result
        return
    
    digit = S[index]
    letters = get_letters_for_digit(digit)  # Get the letters corresponding to the digit
    for letter in letters:
        generate_strings(S, current + letter, index + 1, result)

Function get_letters_for_digit(digit):
    # Get the letters corresponding to the digit using a mapping
    # e.g., mapping = {'2': 'abc', '3': 'def', ..., '9': 'wxyz'}
    return letters corresponding to digit

Function generate_all_strings(S):
    initialize an empty list result
    generate_strings(S, "", 0, result)
    sort result lexicographically
    return result

S = read input string
result = generate_all_strings(S)
print each string in result in a new line
```

**Time Complexity:**

The time complexity of this approach is `O(3^N * N * M * log(M))`, where `N` is the length of the input string, `M` is the maximum number of letters corresponding to a digit (in this case, 4 for digits 7, 8, and 9), and `3^N` represents the possible combinations for the given digits.
