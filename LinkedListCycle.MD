Problem Analysis:

This problem involves detecting whether a linked list has a cycle in it. A cycle in a linked list means that there is some node in the list whose next pointer eventually points back to a previous node in the list, creating a loop.

Approach:

One of the most common algorithms used to detect a cycle in a linked list is the Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm, also known as the "Tortoise and Hare" algorithm. The idea is to use two pointers, one moving at a slower pace (tortoise) and another moving at a faster pace (hare). If there is a cycle in the linked list, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer.

To implement this algorithm, we initialize two pointers, slow and fast, both pointing to the head of the linked list. We then iterate through the list using the following steps:

Move the slow pointer one step forward.
Move the fast pointer two steps forward.
If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer. If there is no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list (i.e., become None).

Pseudocode:

```
slow = head // initialize slow pointer
fast = head // initialize fast pointer

Inside the while loop:
    slow = slow.next // move slow pointer one step forward
    fast = fast.next.next // move fast pointer two steps forward
    
    if slow is equal to fast:
        // there is a cycle
        return true

// no cycle found
return false

```

Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this approach is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. In the worst case, where there is no cycle and the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, we iterate through the list once.

Space Complexity:

The space complexity is O(1) because we use a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the size of the input.
