## Problem Statement:

You are given a binary string containing '0' and '1' characters. In one move, you can select any contiguous subsegment of this string with a length less than or equal to k and change all elements in that segment to '1'. The task is to find the maximum length of a contiguous segment of '1's that you can achieve with one move.

## Hint:

Consider a sliding window approach to find the maximum length of contiguous '1's. Iterate through the string while keeping track of the changes made.

## Short Explanation:


To maximize the length of contiguous '1's, we can use a sliding window approach. Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum length, the current window's left end, and the count of '0's within the window. Iterate through the string with a right pointer and keep track of the '0's within the window. If the count of '0's exceeds k, shrink the window from the left end and update the maximum length when necessary. Finally, output the maximum length.

## Detailed Explanation:


To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach to find the maximum length of contiguous '1's after making one move. Here's a detailed explanation:

Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum length (max_length), the left end of the current window (left), and the count of '0's within the window (zero_count).
Iterate through the binary string using the right pointer.
For each character, check if it's '0'. If it is, increment the zero_count.
While the zero_count exceeds k, we need to shrink the window from the left end. Increment the left to move the window's left end to the right and decrement the zero_count when a '0' is removed from the window.
Update the max_length by comparing it with the current window's length.
Continue this process until the end of the string.
Output the max_length as the answer.

## Pseudo Code:

int t // number of test cases
for each test case:
int n, k // length of the string and the maximum allowed changes
string s // binary string
int max_length = 0 // maximum length of contiguous '1's
int left = 0 // left end of the window
int zero_count = 0 // count of '0's within the window
for right in range(n):
if s[right] == '0':
increment zero_count by 1
while zero_count > k:
if s[left] == '0':
decrement zero_count by 1
increment left by 1
max_length = maximum(max_length, right - left + 1)
print max_length

## Time Complexity:


The time complexity of this approach is O(n) for each test case, where n is the length of the binary string. We iterate through the string once, making it efficient for large inputs.

## Space Complexity:


The space complexity is O(1) because we use a constant amount of extra space to store counters and indices.
This code efficiently solves the problem for each test case within the given constraints.
